Code 1: implement a neural network with one hidden layer from scratch using numpy operations to classify images.
Code 2: Programming Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in Keras and PyTorch
Code 3: Develops a CNN model to classify the images in the CIFAR-10 dataset
Code 4: Transfer Learning: Use a pretrained model such as VGG16 to perform a new classification task
Code 5: Create a GAN Model to generate the MNIST handwritten numbers
Code 6: Sentiment Analysis Using RNN/LSTM
Code 7(Final Project): Business payment delinquency and bankruptcy prediction using deep learning techniques
